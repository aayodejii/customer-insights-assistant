# Customer Insights Assistant

## Project Overview

**Type:** AI-Powered Customer Intelligence Tool  
**Role:** Solo Developer  
**Tech Stack:** Python, LangChain, Ollama (Llama 3.2), ChromaDB, Gradio, RAG Architecture

---

## The Problem

SaaS companies collect thousands of customer reviews across multiple platforms, but extracting actionable insights from this data is time-consuming and inefficient. Product managers and customer success teams need quick answers to questions like:

- What are customers saying about our pricing?
- Which features are most requested by enterprise users?
- What are the common pain points in onboarding?
- How does feedback differ between small teams and large organizations?

Manually reading through hundreds of reviews to answer these questions is not scalable.

---

## The Solution

I built an **AI-powered customer insights assistant** that uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to instantly answer questions about customer feedback. The system analyzes 85+ customer reviews and provides accurate, context-aware answers by retrieving relevant feedback and generating natural language responses.

### Key Capabilities

‚úÖ **Semantic Search** - Finds relevant reviews based on meaning, not just keywords  
‚úÖ **Context-Aware Answers** - Synthesizes information from multiple reviews  
‚úÖ **Role-Based Insights** - Can filter feedback by user role (PM, Engineer, Designer, etc.)  
‚úÖ **Sentiment Analysis** - Understands positive, negative, and neutral feedback  
‚úÖ **Instant Responses** - Answers in seconds instead of hours of manual review

- **ChromaDB** - Stores and retrieves embeddings efficiently
- **Vector Similarity Search** - Finds most relevant reviews

**3. AI Processing**

- **LangChain** - Orchestrates RAG pipeline
- **Llama 3.2 (via Ollama)** - Local LLM for answer generation
- **Prompt Engineering** - Custom templates for accurate responses

**4. Interface**

- **Gradio** - Web-based chat interface
- Example questions for easy exploration

## Implementation Highlights

### 1. Smart Document Processing

```python
# Create rich metadata for better retrieval
document = Document(
    page_content=f"{role} - {sentiment} Review: {review}",
    metadata={
        "rating": rating,
        "role": role,
        "company_size": company_size,
        "sentiment": sentiment
    }
)
```

### 2. Optimized Retrieval

- Retrieves top 5 most relevant reviews (k=5)
- Semantic search finds context, not just keywords
- Persistent vector store for fast repeated queries

### 3. Intelligent Prompting

Designed prompt templates that:

- Set clear context (SaaS product reviews)
- Request specific details (ratings, roles)
- Encourage evidence-based answers

---

## Key Features

### üéØ Semantic Understanding

Ask "Is it expensive?" ‚Üí Finds reviews mentioning "pricing", "cost", "value", "subscription"

### üìä Multi-Dimensional Filtering

Can answer questions like:

- "What do Project Managers think about integrations?"
- "How do small companies rate the onboarding?"

### üí¨ Natural Conversations

Chat-based interface allows follow-up questions and context retention

### ‚ö° Fast & Local

- Runs entirely locally (no API costs)
- Sub-second response times
- Privacy-friendly (no data sent to external APIs)

---

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Relevant Context Retrieval

**Problem:** Sometimes retrieved reviews weren't relevant to the question  
**Solution:**

- Improved document chunking strategy
- Enhanced metadata for better filtering
- Increased k parameter from 3 to 5 for broader context

### Challenge 2: Answer Quality

**Problem:** Initial responses were too generic  
**Solution:**

- Refined prompt engineering
- Added instruction to cite specific details
- Requested mention of ratings and user roles

### Challenge 3: Cold Start Performance

**Problem:** First query was slow due to model loading  
**Solution:**

- Implemented persistent vector store
- Pre-load embeddings on startup
- Optimized Chroma configuration
